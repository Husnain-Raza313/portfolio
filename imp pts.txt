always use round brackets with map function
e.g.

	{list.map((item)=>(
			
			))}

for animation in fonts use ityped.
for icons use material-ui icons.
for animation in general use @keyframes.

Dont give any space between colon of hover and the element.
e.g.
img:hover

to display something on console while using ReactJS use this method for example to print a prop active

{console.log(active)}

when you wanted to send parameters in a function through OnClick 
()=>setSelected(id)

IMPORTANT!!!!

you have to use media query in the end to not let bigger size override the media query values
